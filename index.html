                    <p>This project came to life from watching a live session video of Nick Cave and the bad seeds. It was noticed that songwriters like Nick Cave often use hand gestures and motions to express alterings in musical performance of a band. This thought ignited the idea of capturing such gestures and actually transforming these into certain audio effects in order to explore it as a tool for band leaders and composers. The gestures were captured using the microsoft kinect 360 and the digital signal processing tool Pure Data was used to analyse and translate the data into meaningful signals for a delay, a reverb and volume.</p>

                    <h3>Transforming drawings into 3D game maps</h3>
                    <p>The Map generator is based on image processing techniques in order to translate colors and shapes into playable 3D game worlds. A web cam was used in a start screen to capture drawings from users and generate the map they were about to play themselves. Using traditional image processing techniques, the colors were coded into terrain data and shapes placed on the map were translated into objectives. In this prototype users were able to draw forests, mountains and rivers, as well as start position, end goal, and objects on the map.</p>

                    <p>This game production was aimed at exploring how a completely dark environment can affect players frustration level. Based on the frustration level from each player between the levels, the amount of light was dynamically adjusted with an implemented algorithm. The simple game mechanics and features of the game made it possible to focus on the dark environment and its affect on frustration. </p>

                    As a second album, the game invited fans and listeners into a virtual world build to immerse people into the thoughts on the album. The player were able to find and collect the songs in the sequence they appear on the record. This media proved to be a popular way of distributing music in and the merge of commercial music in a virtual world revealed the potential of it. The project was made by myself entirey and made in order to distribute my own bands' music.</p>

                    <p> Can deaf people make music?. It turns out that deaf people indeed enjoy music and can interact with it in their own way. So we came up with an application that could facilitate the collaboration between deaf and hearing musicians in making music together. The solution is rather simple, however the apporach is novel. The project took ground in the fact that deaf people often feel music and we suggested an additional visual appearance. We created a feeling of the music with colors, and created visual feedback with objects animating to their corresponding sound.<br>The projected was peer reviewd and accepted as official paper on the international conference NIME (New interfaces for musical expressions)
